 WiSH: A General Purpose Message Framing over Byte-Stream Oriented Wire
                            Protocols (HTTP)
                         draft-yoshino-wish-02

Abstract

   This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH
   which supports bi-directional message-based communication over byte-
   stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics).
   The WiSH framing is designed to be compatible with WebSocket.  You
   may want to think about WiSH as a binary and bi-directional
   alternative to the framing defined for the server-sent events [SSE].

1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket protocol was proposed to provide native client-server
   bi-directional messaging for the Web.  It has been implemented and
   deployed widely, but there are still missing semantics and
   functionalities.  See [BidiwebSurvey].

   WiSH is a message framing format for use over the standard HTTP
   semantics to provide bi-directional messaging semantics.  WiSH stands
   for Web in Strict HTTP.  The communication protocol providing the
   HTTP semantics can be HTTP/1.1 [RFC7231], HTTP/2 [RFC7540], HTTP/2 +
   QUIC [QUIC], or any future protocols.  Wire-protocol functionalities
   such as compression, multiplexing, session priority, etc. are
   provided by the underlying protocol [TransportAbstraction].  Unlike
   HTTP/2, HTTP/1.1 doesn't specify if earlier 2xx responses are allowed
   [RFC7540].  Therefore when HTTP/1.1 is used as the underlying
   protocol, full-duplex communication may be broken if the client,
   server or any proxy chooses to buffer or reject earlier 2xx
   responses.  Since proxies may buffer response bodies, communication
   over WiSH may experience extra latency compared to WebSocket.  When
   HTTPS is used, response buffering by proxies is less likely to
   happen.

   Wire-protocol features of WebSocket, such as handshake or control
   messages, are all dropped.  The WiSH framing respects the semantics
   of the underlying protocol (as opposed to turning it to a transport
   protocol).  The concept of fragmentation is retained for enabling

   starting message transmission before determining the final length of
   the message.

   Application-level protocols may use WiSH as the framing protocol to
   support bi-directional communication over HTTP and for Web and
   Internet clients.

2.  Background

   There has been several attempts to improve bi-directional message-
   based communication on the Web.

   The server-sent events [SSE] realized message-based communication in
   the server-to-client direction, by introducing a new Web API and a
   special message framing format while using HTTP as the wire protocol.
   Except for the issue of possible buffering by intermediaries, the
   server-sent events work well with existing intermediaries and
   frameworks that support HTTP.

   WebSocket introduced both a new Web API and a new wire protocol to
   realize bi-directional message-based communication.  Because the wire
   protocol is incompatible with HTTP, intermediaries and frameworks
   have to be upgraded to understand the protocol to support WebSocket.

   In parallel to the development of WebSocket, HTTP has been greatly
   improved with HTTP/2.  There are more improvements upcoming e.g.
   QUIC to the HTTP.  At the same time, the Web APIs for HTTP have also
   been improved.  The XMLHttpRequest is being replaced with the Fetch
   API [Fetch] which allows for streamed uploading and downloading of
   the body part of HTTP messages by using the Streams API [Streams].
   The Streams API also enables implementing data transfer and various
   data processing (e.g. compression/decompression, message framing) in
   the form of the transform stream.  The transform stream mechanism is
   designed to allow for optimizing transfer and processing by
   offloading some part of them from the JavaScript world.

   It's desirable that further evolution of bi-directional message-based
   communication utilize HTTP/2 to reduce cost of development and
   standardization.  Bidi communication should be multiplexed with
   normal HTTP traffic and should benefit from future transport-level
   improvements such as QUIC.

   The WiSH idea is based on the above analysis.  Combination of the
   Fetch API and transform streams enables efficient processing of the
   WiSH framing.  Use of the HTTP semantics as-is reduces cost and makes
   the Web simpler.  Once the WiSH idea is successfully adopted, binding
   to the WebSocket API could be introduced as further optimization for
   existing WebSocket users.

3.  Conformance Requirements and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
   ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc.) used in introducing the algorithm.

   Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can
   be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is
   equivalent.  In particular, the algorithms defined in this
   specification are intended to be easy to understand and are not
   intended to be performant.

4.  WiSH Protocol

   WiSH frames messages over an HTTP request or response body using the
   framing defined in Section 5.

   The "Content-Type" header value of the underlying HTTP request/
   response message MUST be "application/web-stream".

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   WiSH framing is compatible with the framing defined in [RFC6455] for
   the WebSocket protocol.

   The opcode field indicates how to interpret the payload data field.
   WiSH uses the following opcodes.

   o  %x0 denotes a continuation frame



Yoshino & Zhu          Expires September 25, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-DraWiSH: A General Purpose Message Framing over Byt  March 2017


   o  %x1 denotes a text frame

   o  %x2 denotes a binary frame

   Any values not listed here are reserved.

   The FIN bit together with the continuation frame opcode, payload
   length and extended payload length work in the same way as WebSocket
   to represent frames and messages.  The fragmentation mechanism allows
   for flushing part of a large message payload without waiting for the
   total size of the message to be determined.

   The CMP bit indicates whether the message is compressed.  The CMP bit
   of the first frame MUST be set to 1 when compression is enabled for
   the message.  Otherwise, it MUST be set to 0.  The CMP bit of non-
   first frames MUST be always set to 0.

   The message type distinction by the opcode field (text and binary) is
   kept to allow better Web support.  One of the possible use cases is
   to use the text type for exchanging metadata encoded in JSON, etc.,
   and the binary type for exchanging non-metadata messages.

   The status code and status reason defined in the WebSocket protocol
   are dropped.

   The ping and pong control message of the WebSocket protocol are
   dropped.  If such a feature is needed, it should be provided by
   underlying protocols.

   The permessage-deflate extension [RFC7692] is defined for the
   WebSocket protocol, to add a compression mechanism to it.  No
   extension mechanism is defined for WiSH.  Compression can be
   implemented by underlying protocols or in the application layer if
   needed.  What contents are exchanged and in what encoding they are
   exchanged over WiSH are to be defined by the application layer.

6.  Using WiSH over HTTP

   Standard HTTP (REST) semantics should be followed, especially the
   choice of the HTTP method.  Some HTTP semantics may not be
   applicable, e.g. the "Cache-Control" header, when the body is
   streamed.  However, such limitation is not specific to WiSH.

7.  Content Negotiation and WebSocket Compatibility Consideration

   In this section, we discuss how to bridge WiSH and WebSocket.

   The JavaScript binding and wire protocol handshake with WebSocket
   port is future work.  Current thoughts are documented at
   [BidiwebBinding].

7.1.  Subprotocol Negotiation

   When layered over HTTP, a client and server MAY choose to negotiate a
   subprotocol (in the WebSocket term) to use by using the standard HTTP
   "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers.  In order to be compatible with
   RFC6455, a client MAY list offered subprotocols as follows:

       Accept: application/web-stream; protocol=foo; q=1,
           application/web-stream; protocol=bar; q=0.5

   Following the "application/web-stream" media type, a parameter named
   "protocol" is specified with the subprotocol name as its value.  A
   client offers multiple subprotocols by listing multiple "application/
   web-stream" media type with the "protocol" parameter with different
   values.

   The client MAY indicate that the media type of the request body is
   WiSH by using the "Content-Type" header as follows:

       Content-Type: application/web-stream

   Where compatibility with WebSocket matters, symmetric subprotocols
   MUST be used.  When multiple subprotocols are offered, a client MUST
   NOT specify the "protocol" parameter because it's not determined
   which subprotocol will be chosen by the server until the negotiation
   is done.  When a single subprotocol is offered, a client MAY specify
   the "protocol" parameter which is the same as the one specified in
   the "Accept" header.

   The server chooses one subprotocol from the offered ones and notifies
   the chosen subprotocol with the "Content-Type" header as follows:

       Content-Type: application/web-stream; protocol=foo

   The client SHOULD NOT start streaming any data (with the request
   body) before the client receives all the response headers from the
   server, which concludes the negotiation process.

   Where compatibility with WebSocket doesn't matter, the "Content-Type"
   header value MAY differ between the HTTP request and HTTP response
   (see Section 6).  This includes a combination of WiSH and non-WiSH
   media type.

7.2.  Compression Negotiation

   When layered over HTTP, a client and server MAY choose to negotiate a
   compression to use by using the standard HTTP "Accept-Encoding" and
   "Content-Encoding" headers.  A client MAY list offered compression
   methods as follows:

       Accept-Encoding:
           web-stream-deflate;
           client_max_window_bits; server_max_window_bits=10, q=1,
           web-stream-deflate;
           client_max_window_bits; server_max_window_bits; q=0.5

   Each element in the header value consists of the identifier of the
   compression method followed by parameters configuring the method.
   The "web-stream-deflate" compression method in the example shows how
   the compression algorithm used for the "permessage-deflate" can be
   configured for the example.  This example includes the
   "client_max_window_bits" for WebSocket compatibility which indicates
   whether or not the client supports the "client_max_window_bits"
   parameter.

   The client MAY indicate use of the compression method for the HTTP
   request body by using the "Content-Encoding" header as follows:

       Content-Encoding: web-stream-deflate

   The server chooses one compression method from the offered ones and
   notifies the chosen compression method with the "Content-Encoding"
   header as follows:

       Content-Encoding: web-stream-deflate

   The server MAY also choose not to include the "Content-Encoding"
   header to indicate that it rejects use of any compression method.

   The client SHOULD NOT start streaming any data (with the request
   body) before the client receives all the response headers from the
   server, which concludes the negotiation process.

7.3.  Valid UTF-8 Requirement

   In RFC6455, endpoints are required to _Fail the WebSocket Connection_
   when they find that the byte stream in a text message is not a valid
   UTF-8 stream.  To conform to the requirement, RFC6455 server
   frameworks check UTF-8 validness.  The contents of text messages of
   WiSH also MUST be a valid UTF-8 stream.  However, WiSH endpoints are
   not required to check UTF-8 validness.  This provides more

   flexibility to server development.  For example, a server may choose
   to check UTF-8 validness inside a JSON parser.
